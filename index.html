            Hello, this is Amara, and this profile webpage is just to test out
            different designs i can do right now. It's not much but I'm hoping
            to increase my knowledge in CSS pretty soon. So it's probably not
            perfect.

        <div class="p1">
          <h3>Hi 2</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            So my name is Amara, in chinese its <br />谢慧利. And I'm a student
            who's currently in IGCSE preparing my future that's about to take
            place in a few more years. A future that I'm not sure to be excited
            about or nervous.
          </p>

        <div class="p1">
          <h3>Hi 3</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            As you can see, I have an intrest in making webpages, learning new
            things everyday and forgetting them the next minute, wasting my time
            on short videos, reading mangas. Basically anything except studying.
            Unless you tell me to build a website about the topic I'm learning
            about, then i might be intrigued.
